# hvac-controller
ECE 561 project for a home HVAC controller using Arduino Opla platform.

This will have several interconnected components, each one communicating with a different sensor or peripheral.
The HVAC controller will sense and control several metrics related to HVAC.  For each metric, the overarching system (controller) will have two functions:

* Sensing: sensors will be attached to the Opla carrier.


### Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure
